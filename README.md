# Movie-Recommender System

A movie recommender system is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user's choices. The created Web-App using Python is a similar system, which suggests movies based on the user's liked movies.

The model has been trained using a dataset of 5,000 movies! Find the dataset [here 🔗](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
